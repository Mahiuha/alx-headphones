> Implement a design from scratch

## Description
In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You won't have a lot of instructions, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.
